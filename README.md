# Package Tracking Application

The **Package Tracking** app is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in tracking their packages from the postal service, all within a clean and **ad-free** environment.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern and intuitive design.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Get instant updates on your package status.
- **Offline Support**: View previously loaded package information without an internet connection.

## Front-end Technology Stack

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building beautiful UIs in a declarative manner.
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns for a more maintainable codebase.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows SOLID principles to enhance code readability and testability.
- **Ktor**: For efficient API communication, replacing Retrofit.
- **Kotlin Flows**: For handling asynchronous data streams.
- **Coroutines**: For simplified asynchronous programming.
- **Koin**: For dependency injection, providing a lightweight and easy-to-use solution.
- **GitHub Actions**: We utilize GitHub Actions for CI/CD, which is responsible for signing, building, and ensuring code quality through static analysis.
- **Multi-Module Architecture**: The app is structured into multiple modules to enhance code organization and separation of concerns. This approach facilitates better maintainability, scalability, and reusability of code across different parts of the application.
- **Firebase**: 
  - **Remote Configuration**: Manage and update your app's settings and appearance in real-time without requiring user updates. Ideal for A/B testing and feature toggling.
  - **Authentication**: Simplify user login with support for various authentication methods, including email/password, phone numbers, and social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook).
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Track and analyze key performance metrics such as app startup time, network request latency, and screen rendering times to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
  - **Crashlytics**: Automatically capture and report crashes in real-time, providing detailed insights into the causes of issues to enhance app stability and user experience.
